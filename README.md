# Dalitz-Plots-and-Particle-Physics
This was a project which aimed to investigate the Dalitz plots and try to replicate them.
A Dalitz plot is a really elegant way to visualise the kinematics of a three-body decay in particle physics. Instead of plotting angles directly, you plot two independent squared invariant masses, typically m122m_{12}^2m122​ against m132m_{13}^2m132​, for all decay events. Because energy–momentum conservation constrains the system, the allowed events fill a specific bounded region rather than the whole plane. What makes Dalitz plots powerful is that resonances show up as distinctive bands or clusters: if two of the decay products form an intermediate unstable particle, you see a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal enhancement corresponding to that resonance mass. Uniform density would indicate pure phase-space decay, while distortions reveal underlying dynamics and interference effects. So instead of just telling you what particles came out, a Dalitz plot quietly exposes the structure of the interaction happening in between.
